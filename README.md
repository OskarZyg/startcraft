# startcraft

**startcraft** is a CLI tool to assist in the creation of Minecraft servers.

Now, you no longer need to spend hours firing up your browser to download the server version and create a start script. **startcraft** handles it all for you!

Along with handling the server creation, when ran, **startcraft** will check for updates and optionally install it for you! How convenient.

### Why does this exist

Basically, I was bored. I spend lots of time working with Minecraft servers, and my hard drive is filled with random one-off test servers I've needed. While you might think creating a tool to download a file is overkill, it speeds up the creation of the server significantly. Hopefully, you'll find **startcraft** helpful as well.
